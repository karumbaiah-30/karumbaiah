# capstone power bi project

The ShopNest Store Power BI Capstone is a comprehensive data analytics project focused on transforming raw e-commerce data into actionable business insights for ShopNest, a leading online marketplace in Portugal. This project leverages multiple datasets—orders, products, payments, customers, and geolocation—to address core business objectives such as delivery performance, sales trends, customer demographics, and payment analysis.

Key features include the identification and comparison of delayed versus on-time orders, facilitating the optimization of delivery processes by calculating delay metrics and visualizing monthly trends. The capstone also analyzes payment methods, uncovering customer preferences and evaluating sales performance across product categories. Product-level analysis highlights best- and worst-performing items with interactive visuals, supporting inventory and marketing decisions.

Through state-wise and seasonal sales analytics, the project demonstrates regional market strengths and uncovers patterns in quarterly and annual sales data, enabling targeted business strategies. A dynamic dashboard provides a clear comparison of order volumes, payment segmentation, and customer distribution, supported by effective drill-throughs and cross-filtering.

Data modeling and visualization were executed in Power BI, focusing on clarity, usability, and strategic decision support. The project showcases proficiency in data preparation, DAX calculations, interactive reporting, and business storytelling. Overall, this capstone illustrates a data-driven approach to e-commerce management—turning complex datasets into meaningful insights for shop owners, logistics teams, and strategists.


# capstone python project

This Python Fundamentals Capstone Project showcases my ability to manage, manipulate, and analyze real-world data using foundational and advanced Python programming concepts. In this project, I worked with three distinct datasets relating to employee information, project status, and seniority levels, simulating HR and project management scenarios representative of business environments.

The workflow began with importing data for employee profiles, project assignments, and designation levels from CSV files into pandas DataFrames. I handled missing cost values in the project dataset by programmatically imputing the average, demonstrating proficiency in data cleaning and preprocessing. To bring clarity to employee records, I split names into distinct first and last name columns and ensured all transformations were robust and scalable.

The project culminated by joining all datasets into a comprehensive “Final” DataFrame, integrating employee, project, and designation details for holistic analysis. Business rules like bonus assignment (awarding a 5% bonus to employees who finished projects) and designation adjustments (demoting for project failures, promoting based on age, and enforcing eligibility cutoffs) were implemented using conditional logic, showcasing strong command over data-driven decision-making.

Further, I practiced text manipulation by appending salutations to names, handled column transformations, and eliminated redundancies such as dropping the gender column post-enhancement. Advanced skills were applied in aggregating each employee’s total project costs and filtering datasets—for instance, printing details of employees whose city name contains the letter “o”.

This project is a hands-on demonstration of my Python capabilities, including data wrangling, conditionals, aggregation, and string operations. Beyond coding, it reflects my attention to clean, readable data structures and adherence to real-world business logic. The project represents my ability to solve practical problems, deliver insightful analysis, and document the process for clear understanding and reproducibility. I am committed to expanding my skills to tackle larger, more complex analytics challenges on my data science journey.
